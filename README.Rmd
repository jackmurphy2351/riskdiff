The **riskdiff** package provides robust methods for calculating risk differences (also known as prevalence differences in cross-sectional studies) using generalized linear models with automatic link function selection and **boundary detection**.

## ✨ New in v0.2.0: Boundary Detection

**riskdiff** now includes cutting-edge boundary detection capabilities that identify when maximum likelihood estimates lie at the edge of the parameter space - a common issue with identity link models that other packages ignore.

## Features

- **🎯 Smart boundary detection**: Automatically detects when GLMs hit parameter constraints
- **🔧 Robust model fitting**: Tries identity, log, and logit links with graceful fallback  
- **📊 Stratified analysis**: Support for multi-level stratification
- **📋 Publication-ready output**: Formatted tables and confidence intervals
- **🛡️ Missing data handling**: Graceful handling of incomplete cases
- **⚙️ Flexible confidence intervals**: Robust methods for boundary cases
- **📈 Multiple link functions**: Automatic selection with boundary-aware switching
- **🔍 Transparent diagnostics**: Clear reporting of model methods and boundary issues

## Installation

You can install the development version of riskdiff from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jackmurphy2351/riskdiff")
```

## Quick Start

```{r example}
library(riskdiff)

# Load example data
data(cachar_sample)

# Simple risk difference with boundary detection
result <- calc_risk_diff(
  data = cachar_sample,
  outcome = "abnormal_screen",
  exposure = "smoking"
)

print(result)
```

## 🎯 Boundary Detection in Action

```{r boundary-example}
# Create data that challenges standard GLM methods
set.seed(123)
challenging_data <- data.frame(
  outcome = c(rep(0, 40), rep(1, 60)),  # High baseline risk
  exposure = factor(c(rep("No", 50), rep("Yes", 50))),
  age = rnorm(100, 45, 10)
)

# riskdiff handles this gracefully with boundary detection
result <- calc_risk_diff(
  data = challenging_data,
  outcome = "outcome", 
  exposure = "exposure",
  adjust_vars = "age",
  verbose = TRUE  # Shows diagnostic information
)

print(result)

# Check if boundary cases were detected
if (any(result$on_boundary)) {
  cat("\n🚨 Boundary case detected! Using robust inference methods.\n")
  cat("Boundary type:", unique(result$boundary_type[result$on_boundary]), "\n")
  cat("CI method:", unique(result$ci_method[result$on_boundary]), "\n")
}
```

## Key Functions

### Basic Usage with Enhanced Diagnostics

```{r basic}
# Age-adjusted risk difference with boundary detection
rd_adjusted <- calc_risk_diff(
  data = cachar_sample,
  outcome = "abnormal_screen", 
  exposure = "smoking",
  adjust_vars = "age",
  boundary_method = "auto"  # Automatic robust method selection
)

print(rd_adjusted)
```

### Stratified Analysis with Boundary Awareness

```{r stratified}
# Stratified by residence with boundary detection
rd_stratified <- calc_risk_diff(
  data = cachar_sample,
  outcome = "abnormal_screen",
  exposure = "smoking",
  adjust_vars = "age",
  strata = "residence"
)

print(rd_stratified)

# Summary of boundary cases across strata
boundary_summary <- rd_stratified[rd_stratified$on_boundary, 
                                  c("residence", "boundary_type", "ci_method")]
if (nrow(boundary_summary) > 0) {
  cat("\nBoundary cases by stratum:\n")
  print(boundary_summary)
}
```

### Table Creation with Boundary Indicators

```{r tables}
# Create a simple text table with boundary information
cat(create_simple_table(rd_stratified, "Risk by Smoking Status and Residence"))
```

```{r tables-kable, eval=FALSE}
# Create publication-ready table (requires kableExtra)
library(kableExtra)
create_rd_table(rd_stratified, 
                caption = "Risk of Abnormal Screening Result by Smoking Status",
                include_model_type = TRUE)
```

## 🧠 Statistical Methodology

### GLM Approach with Boundary Detection

The package uses generalized linear models with different link functions:

1. **Identity link** (preferred): Directly estimates risk differences
2. **Log link**: Estimates relative risks, transforms to risk differences  
3. **Logit link**: Estimates odds ratios, transforms to risk differences

**New in v0.2.0**: When models hit parameter space boundaries (common with identity links), the package:
- 🔍 **Detects boundary cases** automatically
- ⚠️ **Warns users** about potential inference issues  
- 🛡️ **Uses robust confidence intervals** when appropriate
- 📊 **Reports methodology transparently**

### Boundary Detection Types

- **Upper bound**: Fitted probabilities near 1 (risk saturation)
- **Lower bound**: Fitted probabilities near 0 (risk floor) 
- **Separation**: Complete/quasi-separation in logistic models
- **Both bounds**: Multiple boundary issues detected

## Advanced Features

### Boundary Method Control

```{r boundary-methods}
# Force specific boundary handling
rd_conservative <- calc_risk_diff(
  cachar_sample,
  "abnormal_screen", 
  "smoking",
  boundary_method = "auto"  # Options: "auto", "profile", "wald"
)

# Check which methods were used
table(rd_conservative$ci_method)
```

### Link Function Selection with Boundary Awareness

```{r links}
# Force a specific link function
rd_logit <- calc_risk_diff(
  cachar_sample, 
  "abnormal_screen", 
  "smoking",
  link = "logit"
)

# Check which model was used and if boundaries detected
cat("Model used:", rd_logit$model_type, "\n")
cat("Boundary detected:", rd_logit$on_boundary, "\n")
```

### Confidence Intervals with Robust Methods

```{r confidence}
# 90% confidence intervals with boundary detection
rd_90 <- calc_risk_diff(
  cachar_sample,
  "abnormal_screen", 
  "smoking",
  alpha = 0.10  # 1 - 0.10 = 90% CI
)

print(rd_90)

# The package automatically uses appropriate CI methods for boundary cases
```

## 📊 Understanding Results

### New Result Columns in v0.2.0

```{r result-structure}
# Examine the enhanced result structure
data(cachar_sample)
result <- calc_risk_diff(cachar_sample, "abnormal_screen", "smoking")
names(result)

# Key new columns:
# - on_boundary: Was a boundary case detected?
# - boundary_type: What type of boundary?
# - boundary_warning: Detailed diagnostic message
# - ci_method: Which CI method was used?
```

## Example Dataset

The package includes a realistic simulated cancer screening dataset:

```{r dataset}
data(cachar_sample)
str(cachar_sample)

# Summary statistics showing realistic associations
table(cachar_sample$smoking, cachar_sample$abnormal_screen)

# Risk difference analysis
rd_analysis <- calc_risk_diff(cachar_sample, "abnormal_screen", "smoking")
cat("Smoking increases risk of abnormal screening result by", 
    sprintf("%.1f", rd_analysis$rd * 100), "percentage points\n")
```

## When to Use Risk Differences

Risk differences are particularly valuable when:

- **Policy decisions**: You need the absolute impact size
- **Clinical practice**: Communicating real-world effect sizes
- **Common outcomes**: When outcome prevalence > 10%
- **Causal inference**: For intervention planning
- **Public health**: When relative measures can mislead

## Comparison with Other Measures

| Measure | Interpretation | Best When | riskdiff Advantage |
|---------|---------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Risk Difference** | Absolute change in risk | Common outcomes, policy | **Boundary detection** |
| Risk Ratio | Relative change in risk | Rare outcomes | Standard methods only |
| Odds Ratio | Change in odds | Case-control studies | Standard methods only |
