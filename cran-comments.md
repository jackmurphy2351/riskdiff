## Resubmission (v0.2.1) - Issues Resolved

This is a resubmission addressing all issues identified in the CRAN check results and previous feedback.

### Issues Resolved:

1. **Test Failure Fixed**: 
   - Resolved boundary detection test failure in 'test-boundary_detection.R:187:9'
   - Enhanced `.detect_boundary()` function with comprehensive boundary type coverage
   - Added `get_valid_boundary_types()` function for robust boundary type validation
   - All tests now pass successfully

2. **Non-ASCII Characters Eliminated**:
   - Replaced all Unicode characters with cross-platform safe functions
   - Implemented `.safe_warning()`, `.safe_bullet()`, `.safe_times()` etc. with ASCII fallbacks
   - Package now uses only ASCII characters in R code as required by CRAN

3. **Documentation Fixes**:
   - Fixed function signature mismatches in examples
   - Updated all dataset references from `birthweight` to `cachar_sample`
   - Resolved parameter documentation inconsistencies

4. **Dependency Issues Resolved**:
   - Added missing `ggplot2` to DESCRIPTION Imports
   - Fixed global variable binding issues with comprehensive `globalVariables()` declarations
   - Removed duplicate dependencies between Imports and Suggests

5. **Boundary Detection Enhancement**:
   - Implemented robust boundary detection following Donoghoe & Marschner (2018) methodology
   - Added comprehensive error handling for edge cases
   - Enhanced confidence interval methods for boundary cases

### Test Results:
- **Local**: R 4.5.0 on macOS - 0 errors, 0 warnings, 1 note*
- **GitHub Actions**: ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macOS-latest - All pass
- **R-hub**: Multiple platforms tested - All pass

*Note: The single NOTE about "unable to verify current time" is a common, harmless system-level message that doesn't affect package functionality.

### Comprehensive Testing Performed:
- All 230+ tests pass across multiple scenarios
- Boundary case testing with challenging datasets  
- Cross-platform Unicode compatibility testing
- Backward compatibility with v0.2.0 result objects
- Vignette building and example execution successful

### Package Improvements:
- Enhanced user experience with better diagnostic messages
- Improved statistical robustness for challenging datasets
- Better educational content for public health researchers
- Maintained focus on ease-of-use while ensuring statistical validity

### Commitment to Quality:
All identified issues have been systematically addressed. The package now passes all CRAN checks and provides reliable, robust risk difference estimation for public health researchers.

Thank you for your patience and guidance in improving this package.
