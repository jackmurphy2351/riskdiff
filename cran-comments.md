## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Removed VignetteBuilder field from DESCRIPTION as no vignettes are included
* Updated URL field to point to working GitHub repository
* Added Date field to DESCRIPTION for proper package citation
* Fixed failing unit tests

## Test environments
* Local: R 4.3.0 on macOS
* R-hub builder
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* There is one NOTE about 'unable to verify current time' which appears to be a 
  system/network issue during the build process and does not affect package 
  functionality.

## Downstream dependencies

There are currently no downstream dependencies for this package.
