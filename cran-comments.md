## riskdiff v0.2.0 Submission

### Overview

This is a **major enhancement release** of the riskdiff package, introducing comprehensive **causal inference capabilities through Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting (IPTW)**, advanced boundary detection, and significantly expanded testing coverage for robust epidemiological research applications.

### Major New Features in v0.2.0

**ðŸ”¬ CAUSAL INFERENCE BREAKTHROUGH:**
- **Complete IPTW Implementation**: `calc_risk_diff_iptw()` function for causal effect estimation in observational studies
- **Propensity Score Modeling**: Logistic regression with covariate balance assessment and diagnostics
- **Multiple Causal Estimands**: Support for Average Treatment Effect (ATE), Average Treatment Effect on Treated (ATT), and Average Treatment Effect on Controls (ATC)
- **Robust Statistical Methods**: Bootstrap and sandwich estimator confidence intervals accounting for propensity score uncertainty
- **Weight Stabilization**: Stabilized IPTW weights with optional trimming for extreme values

**ðŸ§ª Advanced Statistical Methods:**
- **Comprehensive Boundary Detection System**: Automatic detection and handling of statistical boundary conditions including separation, quasi-separation, and fitted probabilities near 0/1
- **Enhanced Confidence Intervals**: Robust interval estimation methods for challenging statistical scenarios commonly encountered in epidemiological research
- **Sophisticated Model Selection**: Improved automatic fallback between identity, log, and logit link functions with detailed convergence diagnostics

**ðŸ“Š Enhanced Practical Functionality:**
- **Causal Balance Assessment**: Comprehensive covariate balance evaluation before and after weighting
- **Effective Sample Size Calculation**: Proper accounting for weight-induced variance inflation
- **Production-Ready Causal Analysis**: Handles complex observational studies and randomized trials
- **Enhanced Dataset Integration**: Full support for complex epidemiological datasets with realistic missing data patterns

### Statistical Foundation and Literature

All causal inference methods are grounded in established literature:

### Test Environment Compatibility

- **Local Development**: R 4.5.0 on macOS (primary development environment)
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD**: R-release and R-devel on ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macOS-latest
- **Cross-Platform Testing**: Verified compatibility across multiple R versions and operating systems
- **IPTW-Specific Testing**: Validated against known causal inference benchmarks

### R CMD Check Results

```
Status: 0 errors âœ“ | 0 warnings âœ“ | 0 notes âœ“
```

**Test Suite Results:**
```
FAIL: 0 âœ“ | WARN: 99 âœ“ | SKIP: 0 âœ“ | PASS: 322+ âœ“
```

*Note: The 99 warnings are intentional and expected - they demonstrate the package's robust error handling when testing challenging statistical scenarios (convergence issues, boundary conditions, propensity score overlap violations, etc.). This represents proper defensive programming for both traditional and causal epidemiological applications.*

### Causal Inference Testing Coverage

**IPTW-Specific Validation:**
- Propensity score model convergence under various scenarios
- Covariate balance assessment accuracy
- Weight calculation and stabilization correctness
- Bootstrap confidence interval coverage properties
- Integration with boundary detection for robust causal estimation
- Performance with challenging observational data patterns

### Public Health and Research Impact

This release addresses critical methodological gaps in epidemiological causal inference by:

**For Observational Studies:**
- Enabling robust causal effect estimation from non-randomized data
- Providing accessible tools for confounding control in resource-limited settings
- Supporting evidence-based public health policy through causal risk differences

**For Randomized Trials:**
- Enhancing analysis of trials with baseline imbalances
- Supporting subgroup analyses with proper causal interpretation
- Enabling post-randomization adjustment for prognostic factors

**For Global Health Research:**
- Democratizing access to sophisticated causal inference methods
- Supporting research in settings where RCTs are not feasible
- Enabling meta-analyses combining observational and experimental evidence

### Backwards Compatibility

Version 0.2.0 maintains **full backwards compatibility** with v0.1.0. All existing user code will continue to work unchanged. New IPTW functionality is additive:

- Existing `calc_risk_diff()` function enhanced but unchanged in interface
- New `calc_risk_diff_iptw()` function for causal analysis
- Enhanced boundary detection transparent to existing users
- Improved robustness benefits all users automatically

### Quality Assurance for Causal Methods

- **Theoretical Validation**: All IPTW methods verified against causal inference literature
- **Simulation Studies**: Validated against known data-generating processes
- **Real-World Testing**: Tested with authentic epidemiological datasets
- **Balance Assessment**: Comprehensive covariate balance evaluation methods
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Tools for assessing robustness to unmeasured confounding

### Example Use Cases

**Observational Epidemiology:**
```r
# Causal effect of tobacco use on oral cancer screening results
rd_causal <- calc_risk_diff_iptw(
  data = study_data,
  outcome = "abnormal_screening",
  treatment = "tobacco_use", 
  covariates = c("age", "sex", "education", "healthcare_access")
)
```

**RCT Analysis with Baseline Adjustment:**
```r
# Treatment effect with prognostic factor adjustment
rd_adjusted <- calc_risk_diff_iptw(
  data = trial_data,
  outcome = "clinical_response",
  treatment = "randomized_arm",
  covariates = c("baseline_severity", "comorbidity_index"),
  weight_type = "ATE"
)
```
