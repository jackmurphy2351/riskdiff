The **riskdiff** package provides robust methods for calculating risk
differences (also known as prevalence differences in cross-sectional
studies) using generalized linear models with automatic link function
selection.

## Features

- **üîß Robust model fitting**: Automatically tries identity, log, and
  logit links with graceful fallback
- **üìä Stratified analysis**: Support for multi-level stratification
- **üìã Publication-ready output**: Formatted tables and confidence
  intervals
- **üõ°Ô∏è Missing data handling**: Graceful handling of incomplete cases
- **‚öôÔ∏è Flexible confidence intervals**: Support for different confidence
  levels
- **üìà Multiple link functions**: Automatic selection or manual
  specification

## Key Functions

### Basic Usage

``` r

#> Waiting for profiling to be done...

print(rd_adjusted)

#> Confidence level: 95% 
#> Number of comparisons: 1 
#> 
#>  Exposure Risk Difference          95% CI P-value Model
#>   smoking           8.51% (2.77%, 14.25%)  <0.001   log
```

rd_stratified <- calc_risk_diff(
  data = birthweight,
  outcome = "low_birthweight",
  exposure = "smoking",

```

``` r
# Create publication-ready table (requires kableExtra)
library(kableExtra)
create_rd_table(rd_stratified, caption = "Risk of Low Birth Weight by Smoking Status")
```

## Methodology

The package uses generalized linear models with different link
functions:

1.  **Identity link** (preferred): Directly estimates risk differences
2.  **Log link**: Estimates relative risks, transforms to risk
    differences  
3.  **Logit link**: Estimates odds ratios, transforms to risk
    differences

When the identity link fails to converge (common with binary outcomes),
the package automatically tries alternative approaches.

## Advanced Features

### Link Function Selection

``` r
# Force a specific link function
rd_logit <- calc_risk_diff(
  birthweight, 
  "low_birthweight", 
  "smoking",
  link = "logit"
)
#> Waiting for profiling to be done...

# Check which model was used
rd_logit$model_type
#> [1] "logit"
```

### Confidence Intervals

``` r
# 90% confidence intervals
rd_90 <- calc_risk_diff(
  birthweight,
  "low_birthweight", 
  "smoking",
  alpha = 0.10  # 1 - 0.10 = 90% CI
)
#> Waiting for profiling to be done...

print(rd_90)
#> Risk Difference Analysis Results
#> ================================
#> 
#> Confidence level: 90%

#>   smoking           8.40% (5.70%, 11.37%)  <0.001 identity
```

### Multiple Stratification

``` r
# Stratify by multiple variables
rd_multi <- calc_risk_diff(
  data = birthweight,
  outcome = "low_birthweight",
  exposure = "smoking", 
  strata = c("race", "education")
)

## When to Use Risk Differences

Risk differences are particularly useful when:

- You want to communicate **absolute** rather than relative effects
- The outcome is relatively common (\>10%)
- You‚Äôre doing **causal inference** or policy analysis
- You need results that are easily interpretable by non-statisticians

## Comparison with Other Measures

| Measure | Interpretation | Best When |
|----|----|----|
| **Risk Difference** | Absolute change in risk | Outcome common, policy decisions |
| Risk Ratio | Relative change in risk | Outcome rare, etiologic research |
| Odds Ratio | Change in odds | Case-control studies, rare outcomes |
