The **riskdiff** package provides robust methods for calculating risk differences (also known as prevalence differences in cross-sectional studies) using generalized linear models with automatic link function selection and **boundary detection**.

## ‚ú® New in v0.2.0: Boundary Detection

**riskdiff** now includes cutting-edge boundary detection capabilities that identify when maximum likelihood estimates lie at the edge of the parameter space - a common issue with identity link models that other packages ignore.

## Features

-   **üéØ Smart boundary detection**: Automatically detects when GLMs hit parameter constraints
-   **üîß Robust model fitting**: Tries identity, log, and logit links with graceful fallback\
-   **üìä Stratified analysis**: Support for multi-level stratification
-   **üìã Publication-ready output**: Formatted tables and confidence intervals
-   **üõ°Ô∏è Missing data handling**: Graceful handling of incomplete cases
-   **‚öôÔ∏è Flexible confidence intervals**: Robust methods for boundary cases
-   **üìà Multiple link functions**: Automatic selection with boundary-aware switching
-   **üîç Transparent diagnostics**: Clear reporting of model methods and boundary issues

## üß† Statistical Methodology

### GLM Approach with Boundary Detection

The package uses generalized linear models with different link functions:

1.  **Identity link** (preferred): Directly estimates risk differences
2.  **Log link**: Estimates relative risks, transforms to risk differences\
3.  **Logit link**: Estimates odds ratios, transforms to risk differences

**New in v0.2.0**: When models hit parameter space boundaries (common with identity links), the package: - üîç **Detects boundary cases** automatically - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warns users** about potential inference issues\
- üõ°Ô∏è **Uses robust confidence intervals** when appropriate - üìä **Reports methodology transparently**

### Boundary Detection Types

-   **Upper bound**: Fitted probabilities near 1 (risk saturation)
-   **Lower bound**: Fitted probabilities near 0 (risk floor)
-   **Separation**: Complete/quasi-separation in logistic models
-   **Both bounds**: Multiple boundary issues detected

## Advanced Features

### Boundary Method Control

``` r
# Force specific boundary handling
rd_conservative <- calc_risk_diff(
  cachar_sample,
  "abnormal_screen", 
  "smoking",
  boundary_method = "auto"  # Options: "auto", "profile", "wald"
)
#> Waiting for profiling to be done...

# Check which methods were used
table(rd_conservative$ci_method)
#> 
#> wald 
#>    1
```

### Link Function Selection with Boundary Awareness

``` r
# Force a specific link function
rd_logit <- calc_risk_diff(
  cachar_sample, 
  "abnormal_screen", 
  "smoking",
  link = "logit"
)
#> Waiting for profiling to be done...

# Check which model was used and if boundaries detected
cat("Model used:", rd_logit$model_type, "\n")
#> Model used: logit
cat("Boundary detected:", rd_logit$on_boundary, "\n")
#> Boundary detected: FALSE
```

### Confidence Intervals with Robust Methods

``` r
# 90% confidence intervals with boundary detection
rd_90 <- calc_risk_diff(
  cachar_sample,
  "abnormal_screen", 
  "smoking",
  alpha = 0.10  # 1 - 0.10 = 90% CI
)
#> Waiting for profiling to be done...

print(rd_90)
#> Risk Difference Analysis Results (v0.2.0+)
#> ========================================== 
#> 
#> Confidence level: 90% 
#> Number of comparisons: 1 
#> 
#>  Exposure Risk Difference          95% CI P-value    Model Boundary CI Method
#>   smoking          10.68% (6.68%, 14.91%)  <0.001 identity               wald

# The package automatically uses appropriate CI methods for boundary cases
```

## üìä Understanding Results

### New Result Columns in v0.2.0

``` r
# Examine the enhanced result structure
data(cachar_sample)
result <- calc_risk_diff(cachar_sample, "abnormal_screen", "smoking")
#> Waiting for profiling to be done...
names(result)
#>  [1] "exposure_var"  "rd"            "ci_lower"      "ci_upper"     
#>  [5] "p_value"       "model_type"    "on_boundary"   "boundary_type"
#>  [9] "ci_method"     "n_obs"

# Key new columns:
# - on_boundary: Was a boundary case detected?
# - boundary_type: What type of boundary?
# - boundary_warning: Detailed diagnostic message
# - ci_method: Which CI method was used?
```

## Example Dataset

The package includes a realistic simulated cancer screening dataset:

``` r
data(cachar_sample)
str(cachar_sample)
#> 'data.frame':    2500 obs. of  11 variables:
#>  $ id                : int  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...

#>      
#>          0    1
#>   No  1851  317

# Risk difference analysis
rd_analysis <- calc_risk_diff(cachar_sample, "abnormal_screen", "smoking")
#> Waiting for profiling to be done...
cat("Smoking increases risk of abnormal screening result by", 
    sprintf("%.1f", rd_analysis$rd * 100), "percentage points\n")
#> Smoking increases risk of abnormal screening result by 10.7 percentage points
```

## When to Use Risk Differences

Risk differences are particularly valuable when:

-   **Policy decisions**: You need the absolute impact size
-   **Clinical practice**: Communicating real-world effect sizes
-   **Common outcomes**: When outcome prevalence \> 10%
-   **Causal inference**: For intervention planning
-   **Public health**: When relative measures can mislead

## Comparison with Other Measures

| Measure | Interpretation | Best When | riskdiff Advantage |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Risk Difference** | Absolute change in risk | Common outcomes, policy | **Boundary detection** |
| Risk Ratio | Relative change in risk | Rare outcomes | Standard methods only |
| Odds Ratio | Change in odds | Case-control studies | Standard methods only |
